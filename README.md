## About

This website was created by a group of six enthusiastic Computer Science students from MES College of Engineering Kuttippuram — Adarsh, Hisham, Athul, Ahmed, Mirza, and  Jasir, A, the website developer — as part of our hackathon project. We share a deep fascination with space and technology, which inspired us to design this platform dedicated to exploring the wonders of the universe. Together, we've combined our skills and passion to bring space closer to everyone. We hope this project sparks the same curiosity and excitement about the cosmos that drives us!
